	<p class="aboutme">
Hello! My name is Antonio and I'm a 32 year old Italian fella from a small town near Napoli. I am currently studying at the renowned Mayden Academy in Bath to become a Full Stack web developer. I enjoy the highs and lows of coding, especially the time spent in front of the laptop with a good problem to solve. I particularly love the feeling of creating something, wether a product or a service that people can use. I lean towards back-end development, but as a full-stack trainee, I like to get down with front-end apps and creating styles and pages. I feel confident with PHP, MySQL, Javascript, HTML and CSS, and I just started using Sass and Bootstrap. I also look forward learning other tools and frameworks the course has in store for us to expand our knowledge: Slim and Node.js.<br><br>
I migrated in the UK for a scenery change and worked in casinos for about 3 years before I moved to Bath. Whilst considering other opportunities I remembered how much I had enjoyed the software development I experienced at high school, so decided to apply for the Mayden Academy to help change my career and life! In my free time I like to cook, as a proud Italian, for my friends and girlfriend. I also love relaxing at home watching movies.
